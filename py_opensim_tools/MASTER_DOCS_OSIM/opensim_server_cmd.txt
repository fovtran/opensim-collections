General Server Commands

These commands are available in both simulator and robust consoles.
General

command-script [scriptfile] - Runs a command script containing console commands.
quit - shutdown the server.
show info - show server information (version and startup path). Before OpenSimulator 0.7.5 this is only available on the simulator console.
show uptime - show server startup time and uptime. Before OpenSimulator 0.7.5 this is only available on the simulator console.
show version - show server version. Before OpenSimulator 0.7.5 this is only available on the simulator console.
shutdown - synonym for quit
get log level - In OpenSimulator 0.7.5 and later, print the current console logging level. In OpenSimulator 0.7.4 and earlier please use the "set log level" command instead without a level parameter.
set log level [level] - change the console logging level only. For example, off or debug. See Logging for more information. In OpenSimulator 0.7.4 and earlier, if called without the level argument prints the current level. In OpenSimulator 0.7.5 and later please use the "get log level" command instead. Only available on ROBUST console from OpenSimulator 0.7.5.
Debug
debug http [<level>] - Turn on/off extra logging for HTTP request debugging. Only available on robust console from commit 94517c8 (dev code post 0.7.3.1). In current development code (for OpenSimulator 0.7.5) this is debug http in|out|all [<level>] since outbound HTTP messages can also now be logged (this was only possible for inbound before).

Simulator Commands
General

change region <region name> - subsequent commands apply only to the specified region. If region name is "root" then all regions are selected
create region [name] [filename] - Create a new region
debug packet <level> - Turn on packet debugging, where OpenSimulator prints out summaries of incoming and outgoing packets for viewers, depending on the level set
debug scene - Turn on scene debugging
delete-region <name> - Delete a region from disk
emergency-monitoring - turn emergency debugging monitoring mode on or off.
export-map [<path>] - Save an image of the world map (default name is exportmap.jpg)
help [<command>] - Get general command list or more detailed help on a specific command or set of commands
link-mapping - Set a local grid co-ordinate to link to a remote hypergrid
link-region - Link a HyperGrid region. Not sure how this differs from link-mapping
modules list - List modules
modules load <name> - Load a module
modules unload <name> - Unload a module
monitor report - Returns a variety of statistics about the current region and/or simulator
region restart abort [<message>] - Abort a scheduled region restart, with an optional message
region restart bluebox <message> <delta seconds>+ - Schedule a region restart. If one delta is given then the region is restarted in delta seconds time. A time to restart is sent to users in the region as a dismissable bluebox notice. If multiple deltas are given then a notice is sent when we reach each delta.
region restart notice <message> <delta seconds>+ - Schedule a region restart. Same as above except showing a transient notice instead of a dismissable bluebox.
reload estate - reload estate data
remove-region - remove a region from the simulator
restart - Restarts all sims in this instance
set region flags <Region name> <flags> - Set database flags for region
set terrain heights <corner> <min> <max> [<x>] [<y>] - Sets the terrain texture heights on corner #<corner> to <min>/<max>, if <x> or <y> are specified, it will only set it on regions with a matching coordinate. Specify -1 in <x> or <y> to wildcard that coordinate. Corner # SW = 0, NW = 1, SE = 2, NE = 3.
set terrain texture <number> <uuid> [<x>] [<y>] - Sets the terrain <number> to <uuid>, if <x> or <y> are specified, it will only set it on regions with a matching coordinate. Specify -1 in <x> or <y> to wildcard that coordinate.

config show [<section>] [<key>] - Synonym for 'config get'
Land Commands
land show - Shows all parcels on the current region.

Grid Service
set region flags <Region name> <flags> - Set database flags for region
show region <Region name> - Show the details of a given region. This command is renamed to "show region name" in development versions of OpenSimulator.
The following commands currently only exist in development versions of OpenSimulator (post 0.7.3.1). These are currently found in the "Regions" help section.
deregister region id <Region UUID> - Deregister a region manually. This can be helpful if a region was not properly removed due to bad simulator shutdown and the simulator has not since been restarted or its region configuration has been changed.
show region at <x-coord> <y-coord> - Show details on a region at the given co-ordinate.
show region name <Region name> - Show details on a region

Details of Hypergrid Commands

For full details and explanations of Hypergrid Commands, see the Linking Regions sections of the Installing and Running Hypergrid page.
show hyperlinks
This command will show a list of all hypergrid linked regions.
link-region <Xloc> <Yloc> <host> <port> <location-name>
Use Xloc and Yloc that make sense to your world, i.e. close to your regions, but not adjacent.
replace osl2.nac.uci.edu and 9006 with the domain name / ip address and the port of the region you want to link to
E.g. link-region 8998 8998 osl2.nac.uci.edu 9006 OSGrid Gateway
unlink-region <local region name>
This command will unlink the specified hypergrid linked region - be sure to use the exact local name as reported by the "show hyperlinks" command.
Important Note
Due to a viewer bug, you can only TP between regions that are no more than 4096 cells apart in any dimension. What this means in practice is that if you want to link to OSGrid, you must have your own regions reachable from the (10,000; 10,000) point on the map, which is where OSGrid is centered. Place your regions somewhere in the 8,000s or the 12,000s.
