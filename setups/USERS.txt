Supported Services
## GET
GET allows the client to retrieve all, or some sub-tree of, the inventory associated with a specified avatar's inventory. Inventory information is returned in an XML payload. This request is guaranteed not to affect the state of the avatar's inventory. Possible normal completions are:
200 indicating normal completion of the request. The payload will contain an XML representation of the avatar's inventory.
## PUT
PUT allows a resource, explicitly nominated in the URI, to be created or replaced. I.e. the URI identifies an instance rather than a context. Possible normal completions are
200 if the nominated resource was successfully updated
201 if the nominated resource was successfully created.
204 if no content change (but the resource was recognized and valid)

## POST
POST allows a new resource to be created in the context identified by the URI. It follows from this that the resource identified by a POST request should always be a folder. Normal completions are:
200 if some portion of the context was modified.
201 if the new data was entirely new.

## DELETE
DELETE allows a named resource to be deleted. If the resource is a folder, then the entire sub-tree will be removed. Normal completion codes are:
200 if the specified resource was deleted.
Both PUT and POST allow any assets upon which the inventory catalog depends, to be included in-line with the XML catalog data.
