README

A very basic script to analyze an xml package that can be imported via a Singularity or Imprudence viewer's import xml facility.
From reports, the import package used by Firestorm is slightly different so this may not work on that.
Currently just checks whether required textures are present
XML package currently needs to be unzipped first
