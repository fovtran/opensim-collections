This is a utility to display information about an OAR.

At the moment, it just prints the number of contained assets and the number of contained objects.

In the future, it could do more sophisticated stuff like sanity check an OAR to see that all references (e.g. textures
referred to by objects) are present, though this is quite a lot of work so might not happen soon.

Patches welcome.
